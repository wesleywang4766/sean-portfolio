          I&#39;m a software engineer who loves passion and innovation.
          Throughout my career, I have consistently focused not only developing
          my technical skills but also make a real difference through my work.
          The idea that I embraced at the early stage of my career was
          &quot;It&apos;s not what you know, but who you know&quot;.
        </p>
        <p className="text-start  text-muted-foreground lg:px-6">
          In this ever-evolving landscape, I have honed my craft to specialize
          in crafting awe-inspiring websites that leave a lasting impression and
          immersive gaming experiences that transport players to extraordinary
          realms. With each project, I embark on a thrilling journey, pushing
          the boundaries of technology to create something truly extraordinary.

          Outside of work, I&#39;m an avid reader of blockchain and deep
          learning and enjoy my time outdoors. Looking forward, I aim to
          leverage my technical expertise and innovation to help business grow
          and make everyone&apos;s lives a lot easier.
